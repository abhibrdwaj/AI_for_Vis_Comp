**Explanation:**

1. **Setup Canvas:** Set up the canvas, get the context, and initialize necessary variables like `playerX`, `playerY`, and `direction`.
2. **`initializePlayer()`:** This function sets the starting position of the player within the maze based on finding an empty cell.
3. **`gameLoop()`:** The heart of the game.
   * **Input Handling:** Calls the `handleInput()` function to update the player's movement based on key presses or touch input. 
   * **Clear Canvas:** Clears the canvas before redrawing.
   * **Draw Maze:** Iterates through the maze data and calls `drawWall()` to render each wall. 
   * **Draw Player:** Draws the player at its current position.
   * **Torchlight:** Calls the `illuminateTorch()` function to handle torch illumination.
4. **`handleInput()`:**
   * **Keyboard Controls:** Uses event listeners or API calls to detect arrow key presses and call `movePlayer()` with the appropriate direction.
   * **Mobile Touch Handling (Placeholder):** You'll need to add touch event listeners here to detect touch movements and map them to player direction changes.
5. **`movePlayer(newDirection)`:**  Processes the input direction and updates the player's coordinates accordingly.
   * **Collision Detection:** Checks if the new position is valid (within the maze boundaries) and not a wall.
   * **Direction Update:** Tracks the player's current direction. 
6. **`drawMaze()` and `drawWall()`:** Draw the maze structure on the canvas.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Touch Handling:** For mobile responsiveness, implement accurate touch event listeners to capture player movement on the canvas.
* **Torchlight Visualization:** Decide on how you want to visually represent the torchlight (glowing squares, light cones, shadow effects, etc.). Implement this in `illuminateTorch()`.
* **Collision Detection and Game Logic:** Add more sophisticated collision detection for keys, enemies, or other game objects.  
* **Win/Lose Conditions:** Implement logic to detect when the player has successfully won (collected all keys, reached a goal) or lost (ran into a wall repeatedly).
* **Menu and UI:** Complete the HTML and CSS to create a user interface for the game menu(s), settings, and game over screen.
