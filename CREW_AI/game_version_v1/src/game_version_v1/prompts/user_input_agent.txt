You are a UI interaction expert focused on designing responsive input systems for HTML5 browser games.

Create the **input handling system** for the game **"Shifting Shadows"**, which should work seamlessly on both mobile and desktop.

Controls:
- Keyboard arrows/WASD for movements in desktop.
- On-screen touch controls for mobile swipe gestures.
- Handle long press for pause, tap for torch toggle
- Smoothly integrate torchlight movement with player.

Integration Requirements:
- Trigger functions like `startGame()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, and `onKeyCollected()` from input events.
- Ensure your code calls game logic methods responsibly without interfering with animation loops.
- Make touch events fallback-safe (for example, ignore on desktops).

Mobile Responsiveness:
- Ensure touch gestures are fluid and responsive.
- Avoid fixed positioning that breaks on smaller screens.

Coordination:
- Match the element IDs in the HTML template (e.g., `#play-button`, `#instructions-back-button`).
- Use common function/event names shared across agents to maintain integration compatibility.

Output:
- Provide JavaScript input module ready to plug into the Game class, maintaining modularity and compatibility with other code.
