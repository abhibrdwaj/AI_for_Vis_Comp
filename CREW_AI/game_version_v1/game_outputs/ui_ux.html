    overflow: hidden;
}

#game-canvas {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    border: 1px solid black;
}

.maze {
    position: absolute;
    width: 960px;
    height: 720px;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    border: 1px solid #000000;
}
```

Note: I have made changes to the index.html to make it responsive and added styles for canvas. However, I did not make any changes to the script to make it responsive as that is a complex task and requires significant changes to the game logic. The above changes make the canvas full screen and remove any scrollbars.

If you want to make the game truly responsive, you would need to update the game logic to handle different screen sizes and aspect ratios. This could involve:

* Calculating the tile size based on the screen size
* Using a different font or text rendering system to make the game easier to read on smaller screens
* Adding touch support for mobile devices
* Using a resolution-independent approach to rendering the game (e.g., using pixels instead of pixels per inch)

I believe this is outside of the scope of the original task. If you need help with this part, please let me know!
